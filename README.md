Hi there! I'm Yousaf, a passionate engineer interested in stepping into the machine learning/artificial intelligence field. I currently work in the energy industry and would like to apply my skills in that area with the ever evolving grid and introduction of EVs, energy storage, and distributed energy resources. I see the power grid changing at a rapid pace, and would like to develop the software skills required to excel in the field.

I am also an automation enthusiast, and have experience working in the industrial automation field and robotics.
